    """
    Sparse Weighted box clustering loosely inspired from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08661.pdf.
    For a given bbox, instead of discarding all other overlapping bboxes with lower
    score, it aggregates them all (overlapping bboxes which have not already been aggregated) by
    averaging confidence scores and box coordinates.

    It returns a tuple of:
    - the cluster boxes (pooled coordinates per cluster)
    - the cluster score (pooled score per cluster)
    - the cluster indices: for each cluster, a tuple containing:
        - index of the highest scoring box in the cluster
        (the box onto which other boxes were pulled toward)
        - indices of all other boxes (including the highest one) pulled in the cluster


    Note that this implementation could be further optimized:
    - Memory management is quite poor: several back and forth list-to-numpy conversions happen
    - Some multi treading could be injected when comparing far appart clusters

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : np.array
        Array of boxes, in format (x0, y0, x1, y1) with x1 >= x0, y1 >= y0
    scores : np.array
        One-dimensional array of confidence scores.
    iou_threshold : float, optional
        Threshold from which boxes are considered to overlap, and end up aggregated, by default 0.5
        The higher the lower the effect of this operation.
    score_threshold : float, optional
        Score from which to discard instance based on this confidence score, by default 0.1
    iou_reweight : bool, optional
        Enable IoU reweighting when computing instance consensus, by default False
        If set to `true`, for each box, the higher the IoU with the highest scoring box of the
        cluster, the higher it will contribute to the global (coordinates and scores) consensus.
    cutoff_distance: int, optional
        DEPRECATED, used for compatibility with version 0.1.X.
        Since version 0.2.X, it is useless because overlapping boxes are queried using a R-Tree,
        which is parameter free.
    tree: str, optional
        DEPRECATED, used for compatibility with version 0.1.X.
        Since version 0.2.X, the tree used is a R-Tree.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[np.array]
        Pooled boxes, pooled scores, cluster indices
