class RNode:
    """
    Main object for the node class.

    Note that the tree building process is peculiar:
    Since jit classes methods can not be recursive (node.method can not call node.method), the
    tree building process (recursive node splitting and children instanciation) can not be done
    inside the RNode.__init__ method (which is the natural way to do so).
    However, jit classes methods can call recursive functions: hence, the tree building process is
    delegated to an independant function (see `build` function).
    Consequently, this class must be used in the following way:
    ```
    # Instanciate the root node
    node = RNode(data)
    # Reccursively attach children to each node
    node.build()
    ```

    For convenience, a wrapper `RTree` class was implemented, encapsulating this process:
    ```
    tree = RTree(data)
    # or
    tree.intersect(box_of_interest)
    ```
