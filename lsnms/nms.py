    Sparse NMS, will perform Non Maximum Suppression by only comparing overlapping boxes.
    This turns the usual O(n**2) complexity of the NMS into a O(log(n))-complex algorithm.
    The overlapping boxes are queried using a R-tree, ensuring a log (average case) complexity.

    If `class_ids` is given (one class per object), a class-wise NMS will be applied. This is simply
    done by offsetting the bounding boxes so that bboxes of different classes dont overlap.

    ```python3
    boxes = # array of boxes in format pascal VOC (x0, y0, x1, y1)
    scores = # one-dimensional array of confidence scores

    keep = nms(boxes, scores, iou_threshold=0.5, score_threshold=0.)
    ```
    or
    ```python3
    boxes = # array of boxes in format pascal VOC (x0, y0, x1, y1)
    scores = # one-dimensional array of confidence scores
    class_ids = # one-dimensional array of class indicators (one per object)

    keep = nms(boxes, scores, iou_threshold=0.5, score_threshold=0., class_ids=class_ids)
    ```


    Note that this implementation could be further optimized:
    - Memory management is quite poor: several back and forth list-to-numpy conversions happen
    - Some multi treading could be injected when comparing far appart clusters

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : np.array
        Array of boxes, in format (x0, y0, x1, y1) with x1 >= x0, y1 >= y0
    scores : np.array
        One-dimensional array of confidence scores. Note that in the case of multiclass,
        this function must be applied class-wise.
    iou_threshold : float, optional
        Threshold used to consider two boxes to be overlapping, by default 0.5
    score_threshold : float, optional
        Threshold from which boxes are discarded, by default 0.0
    class_ids: np.array, optional
        One-dimensional integer array indicating the respective classes of the bboxes. If this
        is not None, a class-wise NMS will be applied. If None, all boxes are considered of the
        same class.
    rtree_leaf_size: int, optional
        The leaf size parameter of the underlying R-Tree built for box query.

    Returns
    -------
    np.array
        Indices of boxes kept, in decreasing order of confidence score.
