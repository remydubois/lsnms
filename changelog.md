Changelog
=========

Version 0.4.2
------------
- Fixed issue #22 by releasing Numpy lock.

Version 0.4.1
------------
- Fixed issue https://github.com/remydubois/lsnms/issues/19, by referencing the indicies from the score_mask array

Version 0.4.0
------------
- Dropped support to python 3.7
- Better handling of the dev dependencies in the setup file
- Compatible with python 3.10
- Supports Numpy 1.24


Version 0.3.2
------------
- Fixed issue https://github.com/remydubois/lsnms/issues/12, by masking scores as well as boxes.
- Added torch and torchvision as proper dev dependencies
- Fixed Pillow version (dev dep) to 9.3.0 in dev dependencies because 9.4.0 does not compile on my mbp (see https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/6862)
- Removed deprecated arguments: `cutoff_distance` and `tree`. Removed associated tests.
- Added sanity check to ensure `leaf_size` is strictly positive.


Version 0.3.1
------------
- Edge case where all box scores are zero (or all below threshold) is now handled (threw uggly error before)


Version 0.3.0
------------
- Added multiclass support for NMS
- Use the underlying RNode class in nms now, which speeds up compilation (no need to compile RTree anymore)

Version 0.2.0
------------
- Discarded BallTree and KDTree which are now replaced by a RTree: as fast and hyperparameter-free
  -> `lsnms.nms` is now twice faster to compile (only one tree to compile)
- `cutoff_distance` and `tree` are now deprecated. Warnings are issued when those are specified.
- cleared the tests structure
- added types conversion and sanity checks for data shape, etc
- cached all the jitted function which could (the non recursive ones) -> saves 2 seconds of compilation time at first use.
-> `lsnms.nms` is now hyperparameter free, runs just as fast as before, and almost three times faster to compile at first use.

Patch 0.1.2
------------
- Fixed typo in BallTree (missing dimensionality argument, not used in algorithm but for sanity check in query)
- Updated Numba to 0.54.1


Version 0.1.0
------------
- First version
- Both BallTree and KDTree are implemented for the sake of exhaustivity
- A cutoff distance needs to be specified to discard boxes to distant one from the other
- Compilation time at first use is quite long: 13 seconds and functions can not be precompiled due to recursivity.
